## üìñ Introduction

AI Prompt Builder is a sophisticated tool designed to help users create more effective prompts for AI systems like ChatGPT. By analyzing your initial idea, it generates a semantic vocabulary tree with relevant words, allowing you to construct prompts that yield better responses from AI models.

The app features a bilingual interface (English and Chinese) and leverages the DeepSeek API to provide intelligent vocabulary suggestions organized in an intuitive hierarchical structure.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intelligent Prompt Analysis**: Enter your idea and get a structured vocabulary tree
- **Smart Word Selection**: Choose from suggested words to enrich your prompt
- **Prompt Optimization**: Generate polished prompts based on your selections
- **Bilingual Support**: Full support for both English and Chinese inputs and interface
- **Elegant UI**: Apple-inspired design with smooth animations and transitions
- **Copy Functionality**: One-click copy for generated prompts
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visual indicators when adding words to your prompt
- **Auto-scrolling**: Automatically highlights newly generated content
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on devices of all sizes

## üéÆ Demo

Try out the application by:

1. Enter an idea like "I want to develop a website" or "ÊàëÊÉ≥ÂéªÊ¨ßÊ¥≤ÊóÖÊ∏∏"
2. Browse the vocabulary tree and click on relevant words
3. Click "Generate Sentence" to create an optimized prompt
4. Use the language switcher (globe icon) to toggle between English and Chinese

## üñ• Interface

The application features a clean, intuitive interface with several key components:

### Main Interface
The main screen includes a modern, minimalist input area where users can type their ideas, accompanied by a prominently displayed "Generate Prompt" button. The UI follows Apple's design principles with carefully chosen typography, spacing, and subtle animations.

### Vocabulary Tree
Once a prompt is generated, the app displays an interactive vocabulary tree that organizes relevant words in a hierarchical structure. Each category can be expanded or collapsed, and words can be selected with a simple click. When a word is selected, a subtle animation and visual indicator confirm the action.

### Language Switcher
Located in the top-right corner, the language switcher features a globe icon that rotates slightly on hover. Clicking it reveals a dropdown menu with language options (English and Chinese), each with appropriate styling and a checkmark indicating the current selection.

### Generated Prompt Section
The final generated prompt is displayed in a distinct section with a title and descriptive text. The prompt itself appears in a highlighted box with appropriate styling, and a copy button allows for one-click copying of the entire prompt.
